      <p>The Company shall not be responsible for any issues caused by: (i) hardware, software, or other components that are not part of the Service; (ii) errors or problems caused by your non-compliance with this Agreement; or (iii) errors or problems caused by third parties not acting on behalf of the Company.</p>

      <h3>13. Limitation of Liability</h3>

COMPANY'S AGGREGATE LIABILITY FOR ALL CLAIMS ARISING UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE LIMITED TO THE AMOUNTS PAID BY YOU TO COMPANY UNDER THIS AGREEMENT DURING THE TWELVE MONTHS IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING THE LAST EVENT GIVING RISE TO LIABILITY.</p>

      <h3>14. Indemnification</h3>
      <p>To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, you agree to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its affiliates, and their directors, officers, employees, agents, and licensors, from and against any claims and all losses, expenses, damages, and costs, including reasonable attorneys' fees, resulting from:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>(a) your breach of this Agreement;</li>
        <li>(b) any activity conducted through your account, whether authorized by you or not;</li>
        <li>(c) your violation of any law or the rights of a third party, including privacy, publicity, or intellectual property rights; and</li>
        <li>(d) any dispute between you and a third party relating to your use of the Service.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>We reserve the right to take over the exclusive defense of any claim for which we are entitled to indemnification under this Section. In such event, you shall provide us with such cooperation as is reasonably requested by us.</p>

      <h3>15. Changes to These Terms</h3>
      <p>We reserve the right to change these Terms from time to time. If there is a material change to these Terms, we will notify you either by email, in-app notification, or by posting notice within the Service (as appropriate). We will update the "Effective Date" at the top of these Terms to reflect the date of any material revision.</p>
      <p>Your continued use of the Service after such changes constitutes acknowledgment and agreement to the modified Terms. If you do not wish to continue using the Service under the new version of the Terms, you may terminate your account.</p>
      <p>It is your responsibility to review these Terms periodically.</p>

      <h3>16. Force Majeure</h3>
      <p>Neither party shall be liable for any failure or delay in performing its obligations under this Agreement where such failure or delay results from any cause beyond the reasonable control of that party, including but not limited to: acts of God, natural disasters, pandemics, epidemics, public health emergencies, government actions or orders, war, terrorism, civil unrest, riots, embargoes, labor disputes or strikes, power failures, internet or telecommunications failures, cyberattacks, fire, flood, earthquake, severe weather events, or other catastrophic events (each, a "Force Majeure Event").</p>
      <p>If a Force Majeure Event occurs, the affected party's obligations under this Agreement shall be suspended for the duration of the Force Majeure Event. The Company may modify, suspend, or cancel any contest, Prize, or feature of the Service during a Force Majeure Event without liability. The Company shall use reasonable efforts to notify Users of any material impact on the Service resulting from a Force Majeure Event.</p>
      <p>For the avoidance of doubt, a Force Majeure Event shall not excuse any payment obligations that accrued prior to the occurrence of such event.</p>

      <h3>17. Modifications to the Service</h3>
      <p>The Company reserves the right to modify, suspend, or discontinue the Service (or any part thereof) at any time, with or without notice. We shall not be liable to you or any third party for any modification, suspension, or discontinuation of the Service.</p>
