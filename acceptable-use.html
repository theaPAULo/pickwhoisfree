      <h1>Acceptable Use Policy</h1>
      <p class="effective-date">Effective Date: February 5, 2026</p>

      <h3>1. About This Policy</h3>
      <p>This Acceptable Use Policy ("AUP") is part of your Agreement with Soni Digital LLC ("Company," "we," "us," or "our") and applies to your use of the PickWho mobile application and all related services (the "Service"). Capitalized terms not defined in this AUP have the meanings given to them in the PickWho <a href="/terms.html">Terms of Service</a>.</p>
      <p>You agree to use the Service only for the purposes intended as permitted by the Agreement, including the Terms of Service, this AUP, and applicable laws and regulations. By accessing or using the Service, you agree to comply with this AUP. Violation of this AUP may result in suspension or termination of your account, disqualification from Prizes, and any other remedies available to the Company under the Agreement or applicable law.</p>

      <h3>2. Understanding the Service</h3>
      <h4>2.1 PickWho Is Entertainment, Not Gambling</h4>
      <p>PickWho is a free sports prediction game for entertainment purposes only. You never deposit money, place wagers, or risk any financial loss when using the Service. There are no odds, point spreads, or parlays. You simply predict which team you believe will win a given sporting event.</p>
      <p>You agree not to use or characterize the Service as a gambling, betting, or wagering platform. The Service is not designed or intended to facilitate gambling of any kind, and you must not use it for such purposes.</p>

      <h4>2.2 How Predictions Work</h4>
      <p>Each contest period, the Service will display upcoming professional sporting events. You may select the team you predict will win before the applicable game begins. Once a game starts, your prediction for that game is locked and cannot be changed.</p>
      <p>You agree to submit all predictions manually and in good faith. Predictions must reflect your own independent judgment.</p>

      <h4>2.3 How Prizes Work</h4>
      <p>Each weekly contest may have a Prize. The User with the most correct predictions at the end of the contest period wins. Tiebreakers are applied if needed. Prize eligibility, value, and distribution are at the sole discretion of the Company.</p>
      <p>You agree not to engage in any conduct designed to unfairly influence Prize outcomes, including manipulating predictions, colluding with other Users, or exploiting technical errors.</p>

      <h4>2.4 Free and Premium Access</h4>
      <p>PickWho is completely free to use. You can make unlimited predictions and compete in all contests at no cost. The Service is supported by advertisements displayed when free Users save their picks.</p>
      <p>We offer an optional premium subscription (PickWho Premium) that removes advertisements. PickWho Premium does not provide any advantage in contest participation, prediction mechanics, or Prize eligibility. Purchasing PickWho Premium is entirely optional and does not affect your ability to use the core Service.</p>

      <h3>3. Account Integrity</h3>
      <h4>3.1 One Account Per User</h4>
      <p>Each User may maintain only one (1) account. Creating, maintaining, or using multiple accounts is strictly prohibited. If we determine that you are operating more than one account, all of your accounts may be terminated and you will be disqualified from any pending or future Prizes.</p>

      <h4>3.2 Accurate Information</h4>
      <p>You agree that any information you provide during registration or in connection with your use of the Service will be accurate, correct, and up to date. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of any login credentials associated with your account and for all activities that occur under your account.</p>

      <h4>3.3 Account Deletion</h4>
      <p>You may delete your account at any time through Settings &gt; Delete Account in the app. Account deletion is permanent and removes all of your data, including predictions, statistics, and leaderboard history. The Company is not obligated to restore any data following account deletion.</p>

      <h3>4. Fair Play and Contest Integrity</h3>
      <p>The integrity of PickWho contests depends on every User participating honestly. You agree to the following fair play rules:</p>

        <li><strong>(b) No collusion.</strong> You may not coordinate predictions or strategies with other Users for the purpose of manipulating contest outcomes, leaderboard rankings, or Prize eligibility.</li>
        <li><strong>(c) No manipulation.</strong> You may not attempt to exploit bugs, technical errors, or vulnerabilities in the Service to gain an unfair advantage or influence contest results.</li>
        <li><strong>(d) No fraud.</strong> You may not submit false identity information, create duplicate accounts, or engage in any fraudulent conduct in connection with Prizes or any other aspect of the Service.</li>
        <li><strong>(e) No interference.</strong> You may not disrupt or interfere with the Service, its servers, or networks, or take any action that imposes an unreasonable load on the Service's infrastructure.</li>
